    To construct an secure communication channel between two parties, using a non-shared key, that can be published
    publicly for encryption, and that requires a private key for decryption, we can use the <i>"RSA public-key
    cryptosystem"</i>.<br><br>

    This kind of cryptography will allow e.g. the user to generate a key locally, without any further exchange with
    another party in order to derive a key. TO initialize this process, we need two private primes called <i>p</i> and
    <i>q</i>, in this case <i>p = {p}</i> and <i>q = {q}</i>. Both private numbers will be the used to calculate
    <i>n</i>, an publicly known parameter, by using <i>n = p * q = {p} * {q} = {n}</i>. As the multiplication hides
    the actual value of <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> it is safe to use them for further security related calculations.<br><br>

    In this case, we use <i>p</i> and <i>p</i> to calculate <i>&phi;(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)</i>. This will result in
    <i>&phi;(n) = ({p} - 1) * ({q} - 1) = {phi}</i>. Here it is important to note, that this number needs to be
    kept private, as it is used to derive the private and public key from these parameters in the next step.<br><br>

    Mentioned in the first paragraph, this kind of cryptography makes use of two keys, e.g. <i>e</i> the public key
    and <i>d</i> the private key. Both keys can be calculated with <i>d * e = 1 mod &phi;(n)</i>. As we have now two
    unknown variables, we are forced to chose one. In this case we will chose <i>e</i>, which, because of performance
    reasons, should be an small number, e.g. <i>e = {e}</i>. The private key <i>d</i> can then be derived with the
    formula <i>d = pow(e, -1) mod &phi;(n)</i>. Resulting from that, <i>d = pow({e}, -1) mod &phi;(n) = {d}</i>.

    Compared to the <i>"Diffie and Hellman Key Exchange"</i>, the <i>"RSA cryptosystem"</i> describes a way for decrypting
    and encrypting messages. The formula for encryption is <i>c = pow(m, pub) mod n</i>, where <i>m</i> is
    the messages <i>"{m}"</i>, <i>pub</i> the public key and <i>n</i>, the publicly known parameter of
    key <i>pub</i>. In this case <i>pub = {pub}</i> and <i>n = {n}</i>.

    Using this encryption method and parameters, <i>c</i> will result in the following text (here, every character is
    encrypted with the function and separated with a '.'):

    <pre><code>{e}</code></pre>

    key <i>priv</i>. In this case <i>priv = {priv}</i> and <i>n = {n}</i>.<br><br>

    Signatures play an important role in cryptography, as they allow others to verify the origin of a specific message.
    This is sepcially usefull to any kind of communication channel, as there is no trust required into the message distributer,
    as the signatures can be verified manually. This procedure may make an complex impression, but as we already have
    defined the encryption and decryption methods for the <i>"RSA cryptosystem"</i>, we can use those in order to derive a
    message signanture.<br><br>

    The result of this is, that we can calculate the signature <i>s</i> by the following formula <i>s = pow(m, priv) mod n</i>,
    where we use the same parameters as before, defined in the RSA key generation. In this case the message <i>m = {m}</i>,
    <i>priv = {priv}</i> and <i>n = {n}</i>.<br><br>

    The signatures we will then be able to derive from this forumla is as follows: <i>s = pow({m}, {priv}) mod {n} = {s}</i>.
  </template>
  <template id="m-rsa-verify">
    Signatures are very helpful, as explained in the section for generating signatures. However, we also need to verify them,
    in order to give them a reason to exist. For this we will use the following formula, in order to derive the original
    hash code of the given signature, <i>m = pow(s, pub) mod n</i>.<br><br>

    The hash we will then be able to derive from this forumla is as follows: <i>m = pow({s}, {pub}) mod {n} = {m}</i>.
    Compared to the hash calculated of the message content that is delivered as well, <i>m</i> should be equal to that
    in order to have a valid singature.

    An simple way of initializing an encrypted communication channel, is deriving a shared secret from a key exchange
    done between two different parties. In this case, the <i>"Diffie and Hellman Key Exchange"</i> has been chosen. However, this
    explanation will only contain the steps done with the data received from the server. Any further steps will
    be explained in the next log message that explains how the final shared secret has been initialized on both sides.<br><br>

    To start right away, the server will chose some public numbers <i>p</i> and <i>g</i>, where <i>p</i> will be
    an selected prime number and <i>g</i> any other random number. In this case <i>p = {p}</i> and <i>g = {g}</i>.<br><br>

    Additionally to these parameters for the key exchange, the server will add his part of the key exchange <i>sp = {sp}</i>.
    This part has been calculated with the formula <i>p = pow(g, s) mod p</i>, where <i>p</i> and <i>g</i> will be equal to
    the publicly shared parameters and <i>s</i> to an randomly selected secret number.
  </template>
  <template id="m-diffie-finish">
    As explained in the <i>"shared key parameters received"</i> log message, we already received <i>p</i>, <i>g</i> and
    <i>sp</i>. With these numbers we can finalize the shared key exchange. At this point it is important, to select an
    secret random number for the client, in this case <i>s = {s}</i>.<br><br>

    By using the same procedure of calculating the server shared secret part, we can calculate the client part as well.
    The part calculated for the client needs then to be exchange with the other party, as done with the server part before.
    This will then be <i>p = pow({g}, {s}) mod {p} = {mp}</i>.<br><br>

    Now it is important to merge both parts, into a single key. This needs to be done on both sides, but as it is the same
    procedure, this explanation will be focused on the client only. The client will take the server part <i>sp = {sp}</i>
    and will use the formula <i>k = pow(sp, s) mod p</i>, to derive the key <i>k</i>, that can be then used in a cypher
    for encryption and decryption. Followed by that we can conclude that <i>k = pow({sp}, {s}) mod {p} = {k}</i>.<br><br>

    However, as the size of this number is hard to control, and most cyphers require an constant key size, we can use a
    hash function to result in a same length key on both sides. In this case we use the <i>sha256</i> hash that
    will return the following shared key:

    <pre><code>{sk}</code></pre>

    Having initialized an shared key between both parties, the server and client, we can use this key to encrypt nor
    decrypt a message. As the used <i>"Diffie and Hellman Key Exchange"</i> only describes the way to derive a shared
    secret between two parties through an non-protected communication channel, encryption and decryption functions
    aren't provided. This requires the use of an cypher, in this case <i>"AES"</i> using the <i>"CTR mode"</i>.<br><br>

    The message <i>m</i>, here <i>m = "{m}"</i>, will cyphered with the key <i>k = "{k}"</i> (here 256bit in hex form),
    by the following function <i>c = cypher("{m}", "{k}")</i>. As an result of this function <i>c</i> will be equal to:

      To have a rough overview of all commands, use <code>/h</code> to display the following information.

    <p>
      Every message that contains some extra information, is marked with an <i class="info-btn">(info)</i>,
      which will when clicked, explain some procedures executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get started with the actual messaging protocol, you can use the following commands:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>/s</code> to receive an uid for the current socket session</li>
      <li><code>/o [uid]</code> to select a new message receiver, where [uid] will contain the partners uid</li>
      <li><code>/p [msg]</code> to send a message to a selected partner, where [msg] will be the message content</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Other commands for key exchanges, requests nor ping messages will be handled by this client in the background,
      but will be visible to the user through the debug log in the message window.
